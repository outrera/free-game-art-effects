Just dumping a random bunch of stuff I did while figuring out some procedural animation mumbo jumbo.

update:
Someone asked me for transparent backgrounds for the fire animations.
Because of the way they're generated it's impossible for me to provide those.
However, you can convert the images to grayscale and use those as an alpha mask.
Alternatively you can use one of the RGB channels as alpha.
I found that works pretty well for the fire.
