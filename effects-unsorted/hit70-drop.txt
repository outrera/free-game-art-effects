I know it's a crappy animation, nothing special but the purpose of this post is more to show the source, maybe some ppl want to make this kind of animation in photoshop, so i included the psd source with layers to see how was done.

if you use ps cs 6, animation window is called>  timeline 

(tip). saving for web with Diffusion Transparency dither will show only animation without background, ofcourse if u have no background, if u have, then close layer eye and save.
