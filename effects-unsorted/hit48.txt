NOTE*****
The actual animation is way smoother than the gif preview... is just that i don't know how to make high frame rate gifs xd.**** end NOTE.

Frame by frame animations! :D PNG, SpriteSheet format.

Just a single animation of a "hit", a blood splash, and both put together.

Sprite Sheets in which each frame is a 512 x 512 size image (2048 x 2048 total), 16 frames.

PNG format with transparency.
