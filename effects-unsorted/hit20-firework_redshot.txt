Simple fireworks produced for https://myriad.itch.io/ephelant

The .zip file contains 4 sprite sheets with red, blue, yellow, and violet fireworks, as well as one cut set of 8 sprites for the red fireworks.  The fireworks are the same, but were recolored using Paint.net, and it'd be easy to produce other colorings.
