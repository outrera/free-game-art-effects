Fire Animation (With LOOP !)

GIF Sample does no justice, as the png frames are of high quality.

This great Fire animation package includes:

    .png frames animation [75 frames, 50 frames, 25 frames and 13 frames] at sizes:
        20 x 20
        64 x 64
        128 x 128
        256 x 256

Animations for use in any game or video project (Commercial or Personal).

I release new content at least twice a week, on Wednesdays and Sundays.

More formats and other free content available from my blog. Tilesets, sprites, animations, Music, etc. Free Royalty Free Resources.
