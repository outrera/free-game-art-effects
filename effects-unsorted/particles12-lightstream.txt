This is just a simple wallpaper/background that I made in GIMP a long time ago & had nearly forgotten about. I originally uploaded it to OpenDesktop.org. I don't remember what license I used for it, but it's CC0 now. Sorry, only 1280x1024 resolution available & I did not save the GIMP source. Maybe I will crop it to a 16:9 or 16:10 ratio.
