Two sorts of explosions, two sheets of variants of each type. Each explosion comes with 10 animation steps, and each sheet has 24 variants.

If you need different colors, load them in a graphics editor and use a tool like "change hue and saturation", to adjust the colors.

They are meant to be used with an additive blend, so the black background actually works like a transparent background and the colors work like emitted light.

In a fast paced game the player hardly notices the low detail in the clouds.
