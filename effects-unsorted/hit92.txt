Free Pixel Animations - Christmas Pack

The second of a series of Pixel Animation Packs! This one's free!

This free asset pack contains 12 high-quality animations to be used in 2D games. The animations feature many transitional frames, bringing a level of smoothness to 2D animations that is seldom seen.

This pack is themed for Christmas and as such, contains mostly snow/ice animations. This pack also contains a set of the given animations in the Time Fantasy color palette, ensuring they'll fit the look of any game made using Time Fantasy!

This pack does not contain any Environment animations (such as campfires, waterfalls, smoke effects, etc). This pack is more focused on the combat side of games, featuring frost-fireballs, explosions, slashes, and spell effects. Keep an eye out for the upcoming Environment Animations Pack if you're interested in spicing up your game's maps!

Can be used in most any engine. Can be used for commercial and non-commercial use.
