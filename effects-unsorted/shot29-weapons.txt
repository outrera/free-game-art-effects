This image contains several animated projectiles representing various combinations the air, fire and water elements.

    no element: a simple stone,
    fire: an incandescent stone,
    water: a ball of water,
    air: a deflating balloon,
    fire + air: a gas cylinder with a little flame,
    fire + water: a ball of lava,
    water + air: a bubble,
    water + fire + air: a homing missile.

These combinations are in use in Plee the Bear. I suggest to render them at a smaller size. You may want to rebuild the sprite sheet using Pack My Sprites.

The archive contains the image, the original GIMP image and the files required to recreate the image.
